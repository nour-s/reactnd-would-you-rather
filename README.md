## Would you rather:

The project is a game where users answer "Would you rather" questions with only two options.
The users can also add their own questions so others can answer them too.
There is a leader board that shows the ranking of all users. The rank is calculated to be the number of questions a user has answered plus the questions he asked.
The more you answer and ask, the higher rank you get.
The home page shows a list of questions divided into two tabs: Unanswered and Answered.
By visiting the Unanswered tab, you can click on the option you want to pick in any question, and the question will be automatically moved to the Answered tab.
You can share the question by clicking on an answered question, and copy the url that looks something like this: /questions/{questionId}.

## Quick Start:

First you need to run `npm install` in the project directory, to install all the required packages.

## Running the application:

In the project directory you need to execute:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
